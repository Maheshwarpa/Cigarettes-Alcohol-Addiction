# Cigarettes-Alcohol-Addiction
Analysis on Cigarettes &amp; Alcohol Addiction

### 1. What is the average number of cigarettes smoked per day by gender?

This helps us understand how smoking habits differ by gender. If one gender smokes more on average, it can guide us in creating gender-specific awareness and cessation campaigns.

### 2. What is the average age people started smoking and drinking, grouped by education level?

This shows whether education level affects when people start smoking or drinking. For instance, if people with lower education start earlier, it suggests a need for early intervention and better awareness programs in schools or communities.


### 3. What percentage of individuals report having health issues?

We can use this to assess how widespread health issues are in our dataset. A high percentage indicates a significant health burden, possibly linked to lifestyle choices like smoking, drinking, or lack of exercise.

### 4. What is the relationship between annual income and therapy history?

This tells us whether income level affects access to therapy. If people with higher incomes are more likely to have a therapy history, it indicates possible affordability or access issues for those with lower incomes.

### 5. Which cities have the highest average BMI?

This helps identify cities where BMI levels are high, which might indicate poor diet, low exercise, or stress-related issues. Health authorities in these cities could focus on fitness and diet improvement campaigns.

### 6. What is the average sleep duration grouped by mental health status?

This shows how sleep correlates with mental health. If people with poor mental health also sleep less, it underscores the importance of sleep-focused mental health interventions.

### 7. How many people have attempted to quit smoking at least once?

This tells us how many individuals have made efforts to quit smoking. A large number shows that many are motivated but may need support. A small number might suggest denial or lack of motivation.

### 8. What is the employment status distribution among those with social support?

We can see which employment groups (e.g., employed, unemployed, student) have more social support. This is useful because those lacking support may be more vulnerable to addiction or mental health challenges.

### 9. How does diet quality relate to exercise frequency?

This shows us how often people who eat well also exercise. It helps us identify whether healthy behaviors go hand-in-hand, which can guide programs that promote both together.

### 10. Which are the top 5 countries with the highest average alcohol consumption per week?

This helps us spot which countries have the highest alcohol intake. That information is key to identifying areas needing stricter alcohol policies or community education efforts.

### 11. What is the average number of smoking attempts to quit by education level?

This tells us whether education influences efforts to quit smoking. For example, a higher average among more educated individuals could reflect better awareness or access to cessation resources.

### 12. How does average sleep hours vary by employment status?

This reveals how employment might impact sleep. For instance, unemployed individuals or students might sleep more due to flexible schedules, while full-time workers may sleep less due to stress or time constraints.

### 13. What is the relationship between marital status and average alcohol consumption per week?

This highlights how marital status may influence drinking habits. For example, singles or divorced individuals may show higher alcohol consumption due to loneliness or stress.

### 14. What is the average BMI grouped by diet quality?

This helps us understand the impact of diet on BMI. If individuals with a “Poor” diet quality have significantly higher BMI, it strengthens the case for diet-based interventions in weight management programs.

### 15. How many individuals with health issues also have a current therapy history?

This shows how many people with health issues are actively receiving therapy, indicating how well therapeutic support is being used in populations that need it most.
