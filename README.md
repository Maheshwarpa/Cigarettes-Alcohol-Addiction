Analysis on Cigarettes &amp; Alcohol Addiction

### 1. What is the average number of cigarettes smoked per day by gender?

This helps us understand how smoking habits differ by gender. If one gender smokes more on average, it can guide us in creating gender-specific awareness and cessation campaigns.

### 2. What is the average age people started smoking and drinking, grouped by education level?

This shows whether education level affects when people start smoking or drinking. For instance, if people with lower education start earlier, it suggests a need for early intervention and better awareness programs in schools or communities.


### 3. What percentage of individuals report having health issues?

We can use this to assess how widespread health issues are in our dataset. A high percentage indicates a significant health burden, possibly linked to lifestyle choices like smoking, drinking, or lack of exercise.

### 4. What is the relationship between annual income and therapy history?

This tells us whether income level affects access to therapy. If people with higher incomes are more likely to have a therapy history, it indicates possible affordability or access issues for those with lower incomes.

### 5. Which cities have the highest average BMI?

This helps identify cities where BMI levels are high, which might indicate poor diet, low exercise, or stress-related issues. Health authorities in these cities could focus on fitness and diet improvement campaigns.
